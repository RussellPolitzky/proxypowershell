# Proxy PowerShell Script Requirements

## 1. Core Functionality
Generate a PowerShell script that defines a function to set up proxy details for the current PowerShell session.
The function must set the following environment variables:
- `HTTP_PROXY="http://username:password@proxy.abc.co.za:8080"`
- `HTTPS_PROXY="http://username:password@proxy.abc.co.za:8080"`

After the function is called, these environment variables must be available in the PowerShell session for use by any application (such as `uv`) expecting to see them.

## 2. User Input & Security
- When the user calls the function, she must be prompted to enter the username and password.
- The username and password must be URL encoded down to the proxy URL strings to handle special characters correctly.
- To avoid security issues, the username and password must **not** be saved anywhere on disk or in persistent paths.

## 3. Configuration & Parameters
- The user should be able to override the default proxy server (`proxy.abc.co.za`) and port (`8080`) by passing the proxy server details as parameters to the function.

## 4. Testing & Documentation
- Test the final code by using an open proxy.
- The PowerShell script should include full instructions (e.g., as comments or a README) on how to load and use it.

## 5. Deployment
- Once tested, push the script to my GitHub repository located at:
